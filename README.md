This is my first program that I created using Javascript along side HTML and CSS to make a working web application.
 
 The program is a simple rock, paper and scissors game that uses a function to let the computer randomly choose between rock, paper or scissors from an array of choices whenever a player make a choice, and compare those results. 
 
 There is a logic that determine the winner or draws for each round, which is then added incrementally to a variable, which will determine the winner after the conditions are met.

 Finally, there is another function determines the winner based on whoever has more rounds won.

 I also practiced changing the DOMs to display results, choices and hide them according to the outcome of the game by using Javascript to alter their CSS properties.
